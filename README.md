# 8bit-alu-verilog
# 8-bit ALU Design using Verilog

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and simulation of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The ALU performs various arithmetic and logical operations commonly used in processors.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Verilog HDL
- Icarus Verilog / ModelSim
- GTKWave

## ⚙️ Supported Operations
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Bitwise AND, OR, XOR
- Logical shift operations

## 🧠 Design Approach
The ALU uses combinational logic controlled by an operation select input. Status flags such as Zero and Carry are generated for result validation.
